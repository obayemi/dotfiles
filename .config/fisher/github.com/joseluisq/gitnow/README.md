- (1) This command key binding will creates a new branch taking as name some text of the clipboard.

## Tips

- Skip the password request creating a SSH key for your [Github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) or [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html) account.
- SSH setup is required for using `github` and `bitbucket` commands.
- Take adventage of keybindings in order to get faster operations.

## Configuration

For a custom configuration (for example keybindings) place a [.gitnow](./.gitnow) file in your home directory `~/.gitnow`.

### Keybindings

[.gitnow](./.gitnow) file contains a _[ keybindings ]_ section with default shortcuts (key-value pairs).

You can add, edit or remove shortcuts on demand. For custom keys run the built-in function `fish_key_reader` in your terminal then press the key (or key's combinations) to get the right sequence bind char(s). Finally set it to your preferred command in `~/.gitnow` file.

## Usage

### gitnow

Show available commands and version info.

```sh
gitnow
```

### state

Show the working tree status in compact way.

```sh
state
Current working tree status:
## master...origin/master
 M README.md
 M conf.d/gitnow.fish
```

### stage

Stage files in current working directory.

__Note:__ This command does `git add .` by default. Add your `git add` flags as usual to overwrite it.

```sh
# a) git add . (by default)
stage
# b) custom 1
stage README.md LICENSE.md
# c) custom 2
stage . --ignore-errors
```

### unstage

Unstage files in current working directory.

__Note:__ This command does `git reset .` by default. Add your `git reset` flags as usual to overwrite it.

```sh
# a) git reset . (by default)
unstage
# b) custom 1
unstage README.md LICENSE.md
# c) custom 2
unstage --soft HEAD
```

### show

Show commit detail objects.

__Note:__ This command does `git show --compact-summary HEAD` by default. Add your `git show` flags as usual to overwrite it.

```sh
# a) Default
show
# b) Custom flags
show --compact-summary HEAD~1
```

### untracked

Check for untracked files and directories that could be removed of current working directory.

__Notes:__

- This command does `git clean --dry-run -d` only.
- It doesn't remove anything, just makes a clean checking of files and directories that could be removed.
- No flags are supported.

```sh
untracked
# Would remove .file1
# Would remove dir1/
# Would remove file2
```

### commit

Commit changes to the repository.

__Note:__ This command does `git commit` only. Add your `git commit` flags as usual to overwrite it.

```sh
commit
commit README.md
commit .
commit --amend
```

### commit-all

Add and commit all changes to the repository.

__Note:__ This command does `stage` and then `commit .`. No flags supported.

```sh
# stage && commit .
commit-all
```

### pull

Pull changes from remote server but saving uncommitted changes.

This command makes this for you:

- Save your uncommitted changes locally using `--autostash` option.
- Local changes you made will be rebased (`---rebase` option) on top of the remote changes.
- Return your uncommitted changes locally again.

__Auto mode:__

- `pull`
- `pull <branch_name>`
- `pull <remote_origin> <branch_name>`

__Manual mode:__

- `pull <remote_origin> <branch_name> --verbose`

```sh
pull
üì• Pulling changes
Arguments mode: Auto
Default arguments: --rebase --autostash
Remote: origin (https://github.com/joseluisq/gitnow.git)
Branch: master

From https://github.com/joseluisq/gitnow
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Created autostash: 473315a
HEAD is now at 9de2f93 update commands
Current branch master is up to date.
Applied autostash.
```

### push

Push commit changes to remote repository.

__Note:__ This command is equivalent to `git push --set-upstream [your arguments...]`.

```sh
# Auto mode (current origin and branch)
push
# Manual mode
push <origin_name> <branch_name> <--some_other_flags>
```

### upstream

Commit all changes and push them to remote server.

__Note:__ This command does `commit-all` and then `push`. No flags supported.

```sh
upstream
```

### move

Switch from current branch to another but stashing uncommitted changes

__Note:__ This command does `git stash` then `git checkout <other_branch>` and finally `git stash pop` (possible to disable). It also takes care that `<other_branch>` matches with the existing local branches. 

__Additional options:__

- Use `-u` (or `--upstream`) flag to fetch a remote branch.
- Use `-n` (or `--no-apply-stash`) flag to prevent stashed changes to be applied.

```sh
move other_branch

# Branch `ghost_branch` was not found. No possible to switch.
move ghost_branch

# With -u flag the branch will be fetched from remote origin.
move -u feature/new_remote_branch

# With -n flag stashed changes will not be applied.
move -n feature/new_remote_branch

# Possible to combine two option flags
move -un feature/another_remote_branch
```

### feature

Creates a new feature ([Gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)) branch from current branch.

__Note:__ Your new branch will always be lowercase without special characters or whitespaces (underscores instead).

```sh
feature feat1
# > feature/feat1
feature "This is my New FEATURE Branch"
# > feature/this_is_my_new_feature_branch
```

### hotfix

Creates a new hotfix ([Gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)) branch from current branch.

__Note:__ Your new branch will always be lowercase without special characters or whitespaces (underscores instead).

```sh
hotfix fix1
# > hotfix/fix1
hotfix "This is my New FIX Branch"
# > hotfix/this_is_my_new_fix_branch
```

### bugfix

Creates a new bugfix ([Gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)) branch from current branch.

__Note:__ Your new branch will always be lowercase without special characters or whitespaces (underscores instead).

```sh
bugfix fix1
# > bugfix/fix1
bugfix "This is my New bugFIX Branch"
# > bugfix/this_is_my_new_bugfix_branch
```

### release

Creates a new release ([Gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)) branch from current branch.

__Note:__ Your new branch will always be lowercase without special characters or whitespaces (underscores instead).

```sh
release fix1
# > release/fix1
release "This is my New release Branch"
# > release/this_is_my_new_bugfix_branch
```

### logs

Shows logs in a fancy way.

__Note:__ This command does `git log HEAD` by default using a pretty format. Add your `git log` flags as usual to overwrite it.

```sh
# shows all logs (default)
logs

# shows logs using git log parameters and flags (custom)
logs 8b09088
logs --before "yesterday" --after="1 week ago"
```

### github

Clone a GitHub repository using SSH.

Examples:

```sh
github username/repo-name
github username repo-name
github repo-name # requires a `user.github` username setted
```

### bitbucket

Clone a Bitbucket Cloud repository using SSH.

Examples:

```sh
bitbucket username/repo-name
bitbucket username repo-name
bitbucket repo-name # requires a `user.bitbucket` username setted
```

__Note:__ For cloning some repo only, it's necessary to set your Github or Bitbucket username to global config before like:

```sh
# a) GitHub
git config --global user.github "your_username"
# b) Bitbucket
git config --global user.bitbucket "your_username"
```
